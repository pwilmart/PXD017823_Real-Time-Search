# PXD017823_Real-Time-Search
Re-analysis of data from PXD017823 exploring real time search for TMT.

Rendered HTML versions of Notebooks:

[Schweppe_RTS_by-method](https://pwilmart.github.io/PXD017823_Real-Time-Search/Schweppe_RTS_by-method.html) - This notebook compares the regular SPS MS3 acquisition method with the new real time search (RTS) acquisition method. Note that the RTS acquisition used here also a used protein close-out feature to limit redundant acquisition of peptide from abundant proteins.

[PXD017823_RTS_comparisons_IRS](https://pwilmart.github.io/PXD017823_Real-Time-Search/PXD017823_RTS_comparisons_IRS.html) - This notebook compares cell line expression with edgeR for the RTS data (not the IRS adjusted values).

[PXD017823_Regular_comparisons](https://pwilmart.github.io/PXD017823_Real-Time-Search/PXD017823_Regular_comparisons.html) - This notebook compares cell line expression with edgeR for the regular SPS MS3 data (not the IRS adjusted values).

[PXD017823_RTS_comparisons_IRS](https://pwilmart.github.io/PXD017823_Real-Time-Search/PXD017823_RTS_comparisons_IRS.html) - This notebook compares cell line expression with edgeR for the RTS data after IRS was applied.

[PXD017823_Regular_comparisons_IRS](https://pwilmart.github.io/PXD017823_Real-Time-Search/PXD017823_Regular_comparisons_IRS.html) - This notebook compares cell line expression with edgeR for the regular SPS MS3 data after IRS was applied.
